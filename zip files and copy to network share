python script that will do the following , read a text file and zip the file that are provided in the text file to one file and copy this zip file to a network share by creating a new folder with the machine name if the folder on the network share doesnt exist.

To use this script, create a text file called file_list.txt in the same directory as the script, and add the file paths to be zipped, with each path on a new line. Then, update the file_list_path and network_share_path variables to match the location of the text file and the network share. Finally, run the script and it should create a zip file containing the listed files, and copy the zip file to a new folder on the network share with the machine name.
